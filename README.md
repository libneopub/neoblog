Neoblog, a simple plugin for neopub that provides a minimal and responsive portal for managing your website.

Neoblog is the succesor to [SkyLight](https://github.com/RobinBoers/SkyLight-Website-Editor). It is an open-source blogging system designed with the IndieWeb in mind. It builts upon the strong foundation of [neopub](https://github.com/RobinBoers/neopub), my microblogging platform. It acts as a simple GUI for posting content.
